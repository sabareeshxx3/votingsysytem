                                                                  ----------------
The online voting system implemented in Java allows users to interact with a console-based interface to perform actions such as displaying the list of 
candidates, casting votes, and viewing voting results. The system maintains a collection of candidates and records votes from unique voters identified 
by a voter ID. While the program lacks sophisticated security measures and authentication mechanisms, it serves as a simplified illustration for educational 
purposes. The user interacts with the system through a menu-driven interface, making choices to perform specific actions. This program provides a foundational
understanding of the concepts involved in a voting system but is not intended for deployment in real-world scenarios.

ALGORITHAM
------------

Initialization:
-----------------
Initialize an empty list or map to store candidate names and their respective vote counts.
Initialize an empty list or map to track voters and their voting status.

Candidate Registration:
-------------------------
Allow administrators to register candidates by adding their names to the candidate list.

Display Candidates:
---------------------
Display the list of registered candidates to users.

Voter Registration (Optional):
--------------------------------
Optionally implement a voter registration system with unique voter IDs.

Voting Process:
-----------------
Prompt users to enter the name of their chosen candidate.
Verify that the candidate is registered, and the user has not voted before.
If valid, increment the vote count for the chosen candidate and mark the user as having voted.
Provide feedback to the user regarding the success or failure of the voting process.

Display Results:
-----------------
Display the final voting results, showing each candidate's name and the corresponding vote count.

Exit:
------
Allow users to exit the system.

Repeat:
--------
Allow users to perform multiple iterations of displaying candidates, voting, and viewing results until they choose to exit.
